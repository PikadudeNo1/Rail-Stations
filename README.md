When this is completed, this plugin for your Bukkit-compatible Minecraft server will make 3- and 4-way rail intersections - and by extension, complex rail networks - easy to build. Simply place a detector rail atop a gold block, and the structure will be recognized as a station block. Minecarts passing over a station block will be locked into place. Punch the cart you're riding when it's on a station block, and you'll be boosted in the direction you're facing.

The plugin is not yet complete, so it will not yet function entirely as advertised. There is no public download yet, but the contents of the src folder can be compiled into a plugin.
