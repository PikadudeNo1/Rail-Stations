This plugin for your Bukkit-compatible Minecraft server was made to make 3- and 4-way rail intersections - and by extension, complex rail networks - easy to build. Simply place a detector rail atop a gold block, and the structure will be recognized as a station block. Minecarts passing over a station block will be locked into place. Punch the cart you're riding when it's locked, and you'll be boosted in the direction you're facing. If a locked cart doesn't have a player riding it, you can push it to boost it.
